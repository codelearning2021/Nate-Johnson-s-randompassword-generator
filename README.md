# Module-3-Challenge-Nate-Johnson

## Description
For this assignment, I created several long strings of all possible characters to use in a password then concatenated them together to be able to pull characters from randomly. The user is prompted for which type of characters they will want to use. I also created a variable length of password between 8 - 128 characters based on user input (with validation).
